Initially I started the container with command docker run --rm -it ubuntu sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'
but curl was not installed so I fixed it by starting the container instead with command:
docker run --rm -it ubuntu sh -c 'apt update; apt install curl -y; echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'
